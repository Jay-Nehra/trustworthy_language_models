Why can camels survive for long without water?,,Camels use the fat in their humps to keep them filled with energy and hydration for long periods of time.,open_qa,"Camels have several adaptations that allow them to survive for long periods without water:

1. Water storage: Camels have the ability to store large amounts of water in their bodies. They can drink up to 30 gallons (113 liters) of water in just 13 minutes, which allows them to replenish their water reserves and survive for several days without needing to drink again.

2. Efficient water usage: Camels have a unique metabolism that allows them to conserve water. They can tolerate significant dehydration by reducing their urine output and sweating very little. Their kidneys also reabsorb water from their urine, further minimizing water loss.

3. Fat storage: Camels have humps on their backs, which are not filled with water but with fat reserves. These fat stores can be broken down and used as a source of energy and water when food and water are scarce.

4. Efficient cooling system: Camels have a specialized cooling system that helps them conserve water. They can raise their body temperature during the day, reducing the temperature gradient between their body and the environment, which minimizes water loss through sweating.

5. Adapted diet: Camels have a unique ability to eat thorny desert plants, which are not only a source of food but also contain moisture. They can consume these plants without injuring their mouths due to their tough lips and palate.

These adaptations collectively enable camels to survive in arid and desert environments where water sources are scarce or far apart.",0.8470467413863519

"If I have more pieces at the time of stalemate, have I won?","Stalemate is a situation in chess where the player whose turn it is to move is not in check and has no legal move. Stalemate results in a draw. During the endgame, stalemate is a resource that can enable the player with the inferior position to draw the game rather than lose. In more complex positions, stalemate is much rarer, usually taking the form of a swindle that succeeds only if the superior side is inattentive.[citation needed] Stalemate is also a common theme in endgame studies and other chess problems.

The outcome of a stalemate was standardized as a draw in the 19th century. Before this standardization, its treatment varied widely, including being deemed a win for the stalemating player, a half-win for that player, or a loss for that player; not being permitted; and resulting in the stalemated player missing a turn. Stalemate rules vary in other games of the chess family.","No. 
Stalemate is a drawn position. It doesn't matter who has captured more pieces or is in a winning position",information_extraction,"No, if a game ends in a stalemate, it is considered a draw regardless of the number of pieces you have. Stalemate occurs when the player whose turn it is to move has no legal moves available, but their king is not in check. It is a situation where the player is not able to make any move that does not put their own king in check. In such cases, the game is declared a draw, and neither player wins.",0.8639191073678348

Why mobile is bad for human,,We are always engaged one phone which is not good.,brainstorming,"While mobile devices have undoubtedly revolutionized the way we communicate and access information, there are several reasons why they can be considered bad for humans:

1. Physical health issues: Excessive use of mobile devices can lead to various physical health problems such as eye strain, neck and back pain, and repetitive strain injuries. Prolonged use of mobile devices often involves poor posture and excessive screen time, which can negatively impact our overall well-being.

2. Mental health concerns: Studies have shown that excessive use of mobile devices can contribute to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and addiction. Constant connectivity and the pressure to always be available can lead to increased stress levels and a decreased ability to disconnect and relax.

3. Social isolation: While mobile devices allow us to stay connected with others, they can also contribute to social isolation. Spending excessive time on mobile devices can lead to a lack of face-to-face interactions, reduced social skills, and a diminished sense of community.

4. Distraction and decreased productivity: Mobile devices can be highly distracting, leading to decreased productivity and difficulty focusing on important tasks. Constant notifications, social media, and entertainment apps can easily divert our attention and hinder our ability to concentrate.

5. Privacy and security risks: Mobile devices store a vast amount of personal information, making them vulnerable to privacy breaches and security risks. With the increasing prevalence of data breaches and hacking attempts, our personal information and sensitive data are at risk when using mobile devices.

6. Sleep disturbances: The blue light emitted by mobile device screens can disrupt our sleep patterns. Using mobile devices before bed can interfere with the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep, leading to difficulties falling asleep and poor sleep quality.

7. Impact on children: Excessive mobile device use among children can have detrimental effects on their development. It can hinder social and emotional skills, impede cognitive development, and contribute to behavioral issues.

It is important to note that while mobile devices have their drawbacks, they also offer numerous benefits. The key lies in finding a balance and using them responsibly to mitigate the negative impacts they can have on our lives.",0.8280859917843554
Who was John Moses Browning?,"John Moses Browning (January 23, 1855 – November 26, 1926) was an American firearm designer who developed many varieties of military and civilian firearms, cartridges, and gun mechanisms – many of which are still in use around the world. He made his first firearm at age 13 in his father's gun shop and was awarded the first of his 128 firearm patents on October 7, 1879, at the age of 24. He is regarded as one of the most successful firearms designers of the 19th and 20th centuries and pioneered the development of modern repeating, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms.

Browning influenced nearly all categories of firearms design, especially the autoloading of ammunition. He invented, or made significant improvements to, single-shot, lever-action, and pump-action rifles and shotguns. He developed the first reliable and compact autoloading pistols by inventing the telescoping bolt, then integrating the bolt and barrel shroud into what is known as the pistol slide. Browning's telescoping bolt design is now found on nearly every modern semi-automatic pistol, as well as several modern fully automatic weapons. He also developed the first gas-operated firearm, the Colt–Browning Model 1895 machine gun – a system that surpassed mechanical recoil operation to become the standard for most high-power self-loading firearm designs worldwide. He also made significant contributions to automatic cannon development.

Browning's most successful designs include the M1911 pistol, the water-cooled M1917, the air-cooled M1919, and heavy M2 machine guns, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, and the Browning Auto-5 – the first semi-automatic shotgun. Some of these arms are still manufactured, often with only minor changes in detail and cosmetics to those assembled by Browning or his licensees. The Browning-designed M1911 and Hi-Power are some of the most copied firearms in the world.","John Moses Browning is one of the most well-known designer of modern firearms.
